# CodingSite
CodingHelp.org

This is the repository that houses all of the up to date code for the personal project website
that is being made by me. It includes some mock-ups that I had used and semi-finalized in the creating of some of the pages used in the website.

Overall; the applications and code used to create the entirety of the website are:

- Adobe XD
- Visual Studio Code
    - Css
    - Html
    - Javascript
